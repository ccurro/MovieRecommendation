Since this dataset is relatively small and we do not expect a large number of users, a linear search for the top k movies is feasible.  However, to scale to a larger userbase and a larger dataset, and approximate nearest neighbors index should be used.  While typical approximate nearest neighbors indexes are not adaptable to query specified dimension relevance.  \cite{davethesis} describes an efficient index for handling this type of nearest neighbor query.
