\begin{abstract} 

We present a movie recommendation system that finds a weighted set of nearest
neighbors to an arbitrary desired movie based on user specified interests in a
latent space learned by an autoencoder. We learn a low-dimensional
representation to make recommendations in from a much larger feature space
consisting of approximately one thousand tags and their relevancies to about
ten thousand movies. 

\end{abstract} 
\section{Introduction} 

Movie recommendation is complex task that generally involves high dimensional
feature spaces; a common approach today is the collaborative filtering
approach \cite{ekstrand2011collaborative,good1999combining,koren2009matrix}.
The collaborative filtering approach is powerful because it successfully
reduces a complex high-dimensional feature space into a rich low-dimensional
latent space. We aim to present an alternative approach to generating a rich
low-dimensional latent space capable of producing high quality movie
recommendations based on a nearest neighbor approach where the queried sample
is determined by user input. We work with the dataset created by Vig et al.
\cite{vig2012tag}. This dataset provides approximately ten thousand movies
with relevance weightings for approximately one thousand tags.  We labeled
each of our latent features in a human understandable manner.  We also
provide users with the ability to adjust both the target value and the
relevance of each of these features at each query.

\section{Results} \begin{figure} \centering

\caption{ Reconstruction error versus number of training epochs of the
autoencoder. The reconstruction error is measured as the MSE between the
original high-dimensional vector and the the approximate high-dimensional
vector decoded by the decoder from the low-dimensional code. Each epoch
consists of ten thousand example exposures to the network. This network
converges at an MSE of about 80.}
\label{error} 
\end{figure}

While it is difficult to quantitatively measure the quality of the
recommendations, aside from explicit user feedback on them, we are able to
measure the performance of the autoencoder network. In Figure \ref{error} we
see the usual type of training curve for a neural network with the error
decreasing and then reaching a steady bottom. Ideally this curve would get
significantly closer to zero, but considering the number of dimensions in the
reconstructed space compared to the reduced space, the performance of 80 MSE
is impressive. The apparent quality of recommendations confirms the good
performance of the autoencoder.

We keep logs of all of the queries performed.  These logs of real user data could serve as a valuable dataset for maximizing the efficiency of an ANN index.

\section{Conclusion} We have presented a movie recommendation system that
operates in a low-dimensional space produced by a feature space reduction of
99\% using an autoencoder. We have hypothesized what each of the latent
features in the low-dimensional code represents. In the future we would like
to crowd source an understanding of the latent variables using Amazon
Mechanical Turk as Zhou et al. have done \cite{zhou2014object}.
